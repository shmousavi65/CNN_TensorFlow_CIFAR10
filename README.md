# CNN_TensorFlow_CIFAR10
Convolutional Neural Network developed by TensorFlow for CIFAR10 Image Classification

## Notes:
- Dropout and L_2 Regularization methods are incorporated to avoid overfitting in the training process.
- Data manipulation including random flip are used to improve training task
- TensorFlow Dataset class is used to integrate the reading input task, data processing (including normalization, random flip), and training as
a unifies graph.

## Prerequisits
- Python 3.5
- Tensorflow 1.4
- Numpy
- Pickle

## Usage and Execution
- CIFAR10 data should be exracted and and located in the same directory as the codes files.
- Change the directory to the files and data directory:

cd CNN_TensorFlow_CIFAR10
## Execution
